# **About the Project**

---

This project focuses on building interactive dashboards using several tools, including Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.
Throughout this project, I developed multiple case studies aimed at analyzing sales trends, profit performance, and the spread of COVID-19 based on real-world datasets.
Each dashboard was designed with an emphasis on informative data visualization, intuitive layout design, and ease of interpretation for users.

Through this project, I learned how to transform raw data into valuable business insights, leverage analytical features across different platforms, and evaluate how each visualization tool delivers information effectively.
